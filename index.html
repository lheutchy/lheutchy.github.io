            <p>Hello World! This is my website.</p>
            <p>Hi, my name is Lorinc Heutchy and I am from Redmond, Washington. 
                I am a first year computer science major. Outside of coding I like to watch and play sports, ski, and hike. 
                A fun fact about me is I have been to 10 mlb stadiums.</p>
